    */LED breathing
   - In this section we will make a light LED "breathing" using Python.
   -  The light intensity will start from zero and gradually will increase up to maximum and then will decrease back to zero. 
   -  To do this will use PWM signals. 
   -  The PWM signal is a square-wave signal to control the amount of power going to the GPIO pin, in our case to the LED.
